## Current Task: Add Burndown Feature

I will add a new "Burndown" page to the application. This will serve as a placeholder for future functionality.

### Plan

1.  **Update `index.html`:**
    *   Add a new "Burndown" button to the sidebar navigation with a purple, downward-trending stair icon.
    *   Create a new, blank `section` for the Burndown page content.
2.  **Update `blueprint.md`:**
    *   Document the new Burndown feature in the project blueprint.
